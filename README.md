This is AniClaim, a website where you can collect your favorite characters!
We are using Jikan which is an unofficial MyAnimeList API. (https://docs.api.jikan.moe/)

Users can roll for characters, sell them for currency, see the list of all characters or just the ones they have, and see where they are on the leaderboards.

Looking into how it works, there is a specific chance to get different tier characters with a set value.
Tiers of characters
    S: 1%
    A: 2.3%
    B: 4.8%
    C: 16.4%
    D: 75.5%
    
If you choose to sell a character, the value of it gets added to your wallet. You can see how much money you have compared to others on the leaderboard!
